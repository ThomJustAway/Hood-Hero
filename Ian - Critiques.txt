Make story more detailed - boring ahh story lmao

More detailed graphic/expanded problems

Reconsider UI: do we need a giant red exclamation mark as an action button or can we just tap on the
problem itself lmao

OneService app - do not have the in-game app take up all the screen and disconnect the player from the game -
find another way to blend it into the game

Fake problems - possibly implement problems that may not require reporting, such as '1 + 1 = 2' written in pencil
